3.1

RECONFIGURED FOR FUTURE VIDEOS

The store is now set up to have a counter slice and a users slice which is an array.

We load the store with the counter and the users.

We split reducer into two files and locate in a folder: store.

We use combineReducers in index.js

We also ouput users as JSON.stringify for debug rather than presentation.

This covers tsection 3.1 with 'Pulling future actions'
