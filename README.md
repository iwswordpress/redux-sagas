3.1

RECONFIGURED FOR FUTURE VIDEOS

The store is now set up to have a counter slice and a users slice which is an array.

We load the store with the counter and the users.

We split reducer into two files and locate in a folder: store.

We add an actions file.

We use combineReducers in index.js

We also ouput users as JSON.stringify for debug rather than presentation.

This covers tsection 3.1 with 'Pulling future actions'.

We have limited the data back from randomuser as well.
