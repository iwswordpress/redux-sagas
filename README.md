3.1

We use the example from 3.1 and add the watchAndLog() saga watcher.

To activate it we must put it in the rootSaga array.

We do the same for the loop of 3 todos but replace todos with increment counter and add a case in reducer for SHOW_CONGRATULATION.

The final example of Login/Logout is covered in 3.2 as it is just initially mentioned here.
